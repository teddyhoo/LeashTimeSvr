<p>LeashTime works best when it is configured properly to suit your business.  These checklists cover the major items 
that need to be set up before you start scheduling service with Leashtime and before you offer LeashTime to your clients.
<p>
The first checklist below is one that you should complete before you schedule any client services in LeashTime.  
The time you spend going through it may save you much confusion and frustration later.
<p>
Setting your clients loose in LeashTime is a critical step, so we also offer the 
<a href="#clients">BEFORE YOU LET YOUR CLIENTS USE LEASHTIME</a> checklist.  Completing this checklist can help you introduce 
LeashTime to your customers with confidence.
